The project is a Java Web Application that hosts a bookmarklet.

*The bookmarklet will take the current web page that you are visiting and convert it into a PDF. The PDF file will then be uploaded to your account in Box.net

*It is a nice little utility to take PDF versions of Web pages that you might want to read later.
